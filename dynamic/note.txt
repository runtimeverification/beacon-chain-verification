main theorem
- for a given good state, stateTransition() returns another good state

misc
- no attestations are missed
- once justified/finalized, never change 
- last justified/finalized blocks are maintained correctly


dynamic validators

validator exit
- all active validators triggered to exit, are assigned an exit epoch that is at least 4-5 epochs far from the triggered epoch.
- there is no more than N validators assigned to the same exit epoch, where N is:
  - 0.0015 % of the number of active validators, or
  - 4,  if the number of active validators is less than 262,144
- exit triggers:
  - effective balance is less than 16 at an epoch boundary
  - slashed
  - voluntary exit

validator activation
- all inactive but eligible validators will eventually be assigned an activation epoch that is at least 4-5 epochs far from the epoch they becomes eligible.
- there is no more than N validators assigned to the same activation epoch.
- the activation epoch is assigned in order they become eligible.
