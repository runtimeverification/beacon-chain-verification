main theorem
- for a given good state, stateTransition() returns another good state

misc
- no attestations are missed
- once justified/finalized, never change 
- last justified/finalized blocks are maintained correctly


dynamic validators

validator exit
- all active validators triggered to exit, are assigned an exit epoch that is at least 4 epochs far from the current epoch.
  there is no more than X validators assigned to the same exit epoch, where X is max(4, Va / 2^16) and Va is the number of active validators.
  - exit triggers:
    - effective balance is less than 16
    - slashed
    - voluntary exit
- all inactive but eligible validators will eventually be assigned an activation epoch that is at least 4 epochs far from the epoch they becomes eligible.
  there is no more than X validators assigned to the same activation epoch.
  the activation epoch is assigned in order they become eligible.
